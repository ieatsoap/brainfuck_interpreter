# brainfuck_interpreter
brainfuck interpreter using mips asm

0) requires java for mips
1) navigate to cmd dir of downloaded file and run:
~ java -jar Mips4_5.jar
2) open the file brainfuck.asm by clicking the "File" button in the top left
3) press the build icon and then the shiny green play button

{ i/o is on an almost hidden panel at the bottom, expand with arrows at the bottom left }

defaults:
- file name - "test.txt" { NOTE: .txt file containing the brainfuck code must share a location with Mars4_5.jar }
- memory - program bit memory - 2048 bits
- instruction - instruct. bit memory - 1024 bits
- addrbook - address word memory - 256 words

brainfuck code in test.txt - "simple" program that prints "Hello World!" to the console by only shifting bytes around! very wild

i know this is shit im gonna improve it greatly over the coming weeks. hopefully.
